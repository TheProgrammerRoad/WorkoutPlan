# WorkoutPlan
A simple application to organize your workout plan.

This app gives you the opportunity to create multiple workout plans with each plan having its own name. By klicking on the name in the list of workouts you get to the list of exercises for this workout.
A new workout plan has no exercises included therefore by klicking on the "+"-button you are directed to the new activity where you can then edit a new exercise. 
Give the exercise a name in the first line, some notes in the second and in the third and forth row you have some space to enter the repetitions and weights for the sets while every column represents one set.
By klicking on the Android icon you have the possibility to select an image from your phone to describe the exercise visually. Add the new exercise to the workout list by pressing the button "Neue Ãœbung eintragen".
Continue this with all the exercises you want to add.
